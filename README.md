## 🚀 Overview
FleetZero Insight is a **predictive maintenance system** for electric bus fleets using **Digital Twin technology** and **AI-based analytics**.  
Our solution helps fleet operators predict battery degradation, optimize maintenance schedules, and reduce operating costs.

---

## ⚙️ Problem Statement
Battery failures in electric buses are costly and disruptive.  
- **Average cost per failure:** ≈ **$75,000**  
  ($65K replacement + $10K downtime)  
- Failures lead to service interruptions, maintenance inefficiencies, and lost service hours.

The challenge:  
> How can AI and digital twins predict these failures *before they happen*?

---

## 💡 Our Solution – *NextStop Predict*
**NextStop Predict** integrates real-time fleet data, digital twin simulation, and AI prediction models to forecast battery health and performance trends.

Real-Time Fleet Data → Digital Twin Simulation → AI Prediction & Insights

✅ Predicts failures **2–3 weeks in advance**  
✅ Reduces maintenance cost by **≈66.7%**  
✅ Extends battery lifespan by **20–25%**
